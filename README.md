Perceptual Color Space and Language based on the CAM16 Uniform Color Space

## Color Space Background
color-cam16 is a TypeScript library for defining and manipulating colors. Generate color sequences. Define color relationships. Determine color differences. Find analogous and complimentary colors. Ensure color contrast. Match real world colors.

The library uses a uniform color space based on human perception and human semantics. Colors can be warmer or cooler, lighter or darker, stronger or weaker.  You can define a set of colors and their relationships in plain text.  The library can parse a color description and calculate the relevant colors of a theme.
